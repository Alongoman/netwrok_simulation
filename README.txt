TSOR:
will simulate TSOR algorithm as represented in:
Zhiming Huang, Yifan Xu, Jianping Pan, “TSOR: Thompson Sampling-Based
Opportunistic Routing”, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 20, no.
Nov. 2021

To run with prints of packet forwarding run TSOR_sim.py, otherwise run TSOR_sim_no_prints.py
Chose packet range to run the algorithm on and number of iterations to mean the results over.
This will show the graphs of average Payoff and Regret

network_sim:
this code will simulate serial network and "web" network topologies.
will update rates for users using gradient descent/ascent or by Dijkstra/ Bellman-Ford algorithm
