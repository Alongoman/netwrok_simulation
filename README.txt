TSOR:
will simulate TSOR algorithm as represented in:
Zhiming Huang, Yifan Xu, Jianping Pan, “TSOR: Thompson Sampling-Based
Opportunistic Routing”, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 20, no.
Nov. 2021


network_sim:
this code will simulate serial network and "web" network topologies.
will update rates for users using gradient descent/ascent or by Dijkstra/ Bellman-Ford algorithm

if you want to use costume network follow instruction prints while runnint network_sim.py and inserting y to the first question
